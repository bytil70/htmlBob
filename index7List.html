      <dt>dragon</dt>
      <dd>
        A dragon is a magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of
        multiple cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably
        through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle
        Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of
        breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as
        wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average
        intelligence.

      <dt>phoenix</dt>
      <dd>
        The phoenix is a legendary immortal bird that cyclically regenerates or
        is otherwise born again. Originating in Greek mythology, it has analogs
        in many cultures, such as Egyptian and Persian mythology. Associated
        with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its
        predecessor.

      <dt>vampire</dt>
      <dd>
        A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital
        essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European
        folklore, vampires are undead humanoid creatures that often visited
        loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which
        they inhabited while they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often
        described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly
        different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early
        19th century.
